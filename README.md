# Banking in the Cloud

## Off to a Hot Start

Chime is a digital banking company founded by Chris Britt and Ryan King in 2012. Headquartered in San Francisco, CA, the company officially launched in 2014 as a mobile banking app, offerings no-fee accounts, and paycheck advances. It has since grown to offer a variety of services including automated savings, credit building debit cards, loans, and credit cards. Chris and Ryan founded Chime on the idea that banking should be readily accessible for everyone, and that a bank should profit with its members, not from them. This and other core tenants have helped Chime grow from $80 million in revenue in 2018, to an estimated $3.16 billion in 2023. See the full graph of Chime's revenue since 2018 [here](https://prioridata.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Chime-Revenue-1-1024x576.png). Since its launch, Chime has raised over [$2 billion](https://tracxn.com/d/companies/chime/__wN_29a66OuJnVO8CybgtKmYXjwL5IX7QjQw65EY4QIg#:~:text=Funding%20and%20Investors%20of%20Chime&text=Chime%20has%20raised%20a%20total%20funding%20of%20%242.09B%20over%208%20rounds.) in funding, the latest round in 2021 raised $750 million. So why have customers and investers alike been so excited about Chime? Lets take a deeper below.

## Breaking the Mold

In many ways, Chime is challenging the idea of traditional banking. Unlike bigger, more conventional banks, Chime requires no account minimums nor charges any overdraft fees. This alone is enough to attract many users. According to [Bankrate.com](https://www.bankrate.com/finance/credit-cards/living-paycheck-to-paycheck-statistics/), over 50% of Americans live paycheck to paycheck as of September, 2023. So before any additional offers, over 50% of Americans already have one reason to consider making the switch to Chime.

Another way Chime is challenging traditional banking is its lack of physical branches. Chime has always been a mobile first, web-based banking service, offering all of their services at the convenience of the user's cellphone or computer. This may be a turn off for customers who preferred to make deposits, withdrawals, and apply for loans by speaking with a representative, but those customers aren't necessarily in Chime's targeted demographic. Indeed the target demographic skews younger than most other banks, specifically targeting Millenials and GenZ. According to [Forbes.com](https://www.forbes.com/sites/ronshevlin/2022/05/16/2022-online-bank-ranking-chime-at-the-top-current-coming-on-strong/?sh=7d099ae81573), more than 25% of GenZ and nearly 33% of Millenials use a digital bank as their primary provider. It is no secret that younger generations prefer online services for most things and banking has proved to be no exception. Chime may have been ahead of the curve when it launched in 2014, but now in 2023 they have a proven record of accountability as more and more customers consider making the switch to digital banking.

## Market Size

"Neobanking" is the term for the market in which Chime operates. This industry includes digital financial institutions operating solely online. The last decade has seen a steady increase in the neobanking industry's market size. In [2021](https://research.contrary.com/reports/chime), the market size was over $45 billion, in [2022](https://www.grandviewresearch.com/industry-analysis/neobanking-market) it exceeded $66 billion and by 2028 it is expected to reach $600 billion. Clearly there is plenty of room for Chime to continue to grow at a staggering rate, despite its already lucrative start. 

## Challengers

Given the rapidly expanding market size of neobanking, hundred of companies are trying to claim their piece of the pie, just like Chime. Specifically Current, SoFi, and Cash App offer similiar banking products and financial services.

#### *Current*

Current offers similar products as Chime, such as no-fee accounts, early paycheck withdrawal, and automated savings. However, Current also offers crytocurrency trading and accounts specialized for teenagers. With an average customer age of 27, Current and Chime are certainly vying for their piece of neobanking market.

#### *SoFi*

SoFi is another major player in the neobanking market. Founded in 2011, before Chime, SoFi offers a variety of tools for investing, spending, saving, and borrowing, all on its app. This makes SoFi one of the most comprehensive and well established digital banking companies in the market today. With a net revenue of $1.5 billion in 2022 and an expected net revenue of [$2 billion](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/sofi-technologies-inc-sofi-reports-124021425.html#:~:text=Outlook%20and%20Guidance,of%20%24333%20to%20%24343%20million.) in 2023, SoFi and Chime have been jostling for positioning in an expanding market for years.

#### *Cash App*

Cash App started in 2013 as a peer-to-peer payment platform, similar to Paypal or venmo. It has since expanded into digital banking, trading, and tax filing. Cash App now offers some of the same services as Chime, including fee-free checking, automated savings, and loan options. However, Cash App has historically prioritized peer-to-peer transfers, leaving them a step behind Chime's established reputation in the digital banking field specifically.


## Market Trends

Chime, and its competitors, operate under the FinTech domain in the noebanking market. We've discussed already how quickly the market for digital banking is expanding, but what other trends are emerging as the market develops?

### Consolidation

FinTech in general is a relatively new market, [Simple](https://www.finextra.com/newsarticle/37234/simple-shuts-down) was the first neobank to emerge back in 2009. They closed their doors in 2021 when their parent firm BBVA was aquired by PNC. According to [Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/sarahkocianski/2023/01/17/where-will-2023s-fintech-ma-happen/?sh=515115b35afc), many neobank startups have been forced to close their doors due to frequent regulatory changes as the market evolves and takes shape. The waters may not be as choppy as they have been historically, but the bigger [fish](https://www.google.com/search?q=biggest+neobanks&sca_esv=590654907&rlz=1C5CHFA_enUS963US963&ei=8hd6ZaeaNLLfkPIP7-KTiAY&ved=0ahUKEwin27X_o42DAxWyL0QIHW_xBGEQ4dUDCBE&uact=5&oq=biggest+neobanks&gs_lp=Egxnd3Mtd2l6LXNlcnAiEGJpZ2dlc3QgbmVvYmFua3MyCxAAGIAEGIoFGJECMgUQABiABDIFEAAYgAQyBRAAGIAEMgUQABiABDIEEAAYHjIEEAAYHjILEAAYgAQYigUYhgMyCxAAGIAEGIoFGIYDSI0FUABYAHAAeAGQAQCYAbIBoAGyAaoBAzAuMbgBA8gBAPgBAeIDBBgAIEGIBgE&sclient=gws-wiz-serp) who have weathered the storm up to now, are financially situated to aqcuire the younger players and support their revenue streams. Since its launch, Chime as acquired [two](https://www.crunchbase.com/search/acquisitions/field/organization.companies/num_acquisitions/chime-2) companies: [Pinch](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/ferment-labs), and [Charlie Finance Co.](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/ferment-labs).

### One Stop Shopping

Another major trend in the neobanking market is the rise of Embedded Finance. According to [Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2023/05/31/why-niche-financial-services-could-be-the-next-embedded-finance-trend/?sh=1314ef5a6b61), financial services embedded into embedded digital platforms will exceed $7 trillion by 2026. Above we discussed how both Current and SoFi have expanded to provide a more comprehensive suite of financial tools. SoFi especially is a market leader in providing its customers a one stop shop for all things banking, borrowing, and investing. Chime is not too far behind, since it launched its [credit builder](https://www.chime.com/credit-builder/) debit card, the valuation of Chime as risen over $19 billion, from [$5.8 billion](https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/30/u-s-challenger-bank-chime-launches-credit-builder-a-credit-card-that-works-more-like-debit/)in 2020, to [$25 billion](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/05/09/chime-disruptor-50.html) in 2023.
