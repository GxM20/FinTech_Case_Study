(https://www.business.org/app/uploads/2022/08/Chime-logo-300x86.png)

## Off to a Hot Start

Chime is a digital banking company founded by Chris Britt and Ryan King in 2012. Headquartered in San Francisco, CA, the company officially launched in 2014 as a mobile banking app, offerings no-fee accounts, and paycheck advances. It has since grown to offer a variety of services including automated savings, credit building debit cards, loans, and credit cards. Chris and Ryan founded Chime on the idea that banking should be readily accessible for everyone, and that a bank should profit with its members, not from them. This and other core tenants have helped Chime grow from $80 million in revenue in 2018, to an estimated $3.16 billion in 2023. See the full graph of Chime's revenue since 2018 [here](https://prioridata.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Chime-Revenue-1-1024x576.png). Since its launch, Chime has raised over [$2 billion](https://tracxn.com/d/companies/chime/__wN_29a66OuJnVO8CybgtKmYXjwL5IX7QjQw65EY4QIg#:~:text=Funding%20and%20Investors%20of%20Chime&text=Chime%20has%20raised%20a%20total%20funding%20of%20%242.09B%20over%208%20rounds.) in funding, the latest round in 2021 raised $750 million. So why have customers and investers alike been so excited about Chime? Lets take a deeper below.

## Breaking the Mold

In many ways, Chime is challenging the idea of traditional banking. Unlike bigger, more conventional banks, Chime requires no account minimums nor charges any overdraft fees. This alone is enough to attract many users. According to [Bankrate.com](https://www.bankrate.com/finance/credit-cards/living-paycheck-to-paycheck-statistics/), over 50% of Americans live paycheck to paycheck as of September, 2023. So before any additional offers, over 50% of Americans already have one reason to consider making the switch to Chime.

Another way Chime is challenging traditional banking is its lack of physical branches. Chime has always been a mobile first, web-based banking service, offering all of their services at the convenience of the user's cellphone or computer. This may be a turn off for customers who preferred to make deposits, withdrawals, and apply for loans by speaking with a representative, but those customers aren't necessarily in Chime's targeted demographic. Indeed the target demographic skews younger than most other banks, specifically targeting Millenials and GenZ. According to [Forbes.com](https://www.forbes.com/sites/ronshevlin/2022/05/16/2022-online-bank-ranking-chime-at-the-top-current-coming-on-strong/?sh=7d099ae81573), more than 25% of GenZ and nearly 33% of Millenials use a digital bank as their primary provider. It is no secret that younger generations prefer online services for most things and banking has proved to be no exception. Chime may have been ahead of the curve when it launched in 2014, but now in 2023 they have a proven record of accountability as more and more customers consider making the switch to digital banking.
