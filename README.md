# Chime, Banking in the Cloud

## A Hot Start Since Launch

Chime is a digital banking company founded by Chris Britt and Ryan King in 2012. The company officially launched in 2014 as a mobile banking app, offerings no-fee accounts, and paycheck advances. It has since grown to offer a variety of services including automated savings, credit building debit cards, loans, and credit cards. Chris and Ryan founded Chime on the idea that banking should be readily accessible for everyone, and that a bank should profit with its members, not from them. This and other core tenants have helped Chime grow from $80 million in revenue in 2018, to an estimated $3.16 billion in 2023.
